Hello, I'm Micheal Ndoh, an enthusiastic IT professional with a passion for innovation and growth. I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and explore opportunities to enhance my skills and knowledge.

## About Me
* I'm currently pursuing my career in software engineering at [CLEMIOS](https://clemios.com/), where I'm honing my skills in software development and design.
* I've recently deploy a mkdocs docker image package which contains notes and resources for LPIC 1 certification and can be accessed through my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/micheal-ndoh/MK_DOCS.git).
* I'm eager to collaborate with fellow IT enthusiasts, learn from their experiences, and contribute to the growth of the tech community and also grow my experience.
